    heading: "What is React?",
    body: "React is a popular JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, reusable components. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render only the parts of the page that change, making applications fast and scalable."
  },
  {
    heading: "What is an Accordion?",
    body: "An accordion is a user interface component that allows you to toggle the visibility of sections of related content. Typically, it consists of a list of headers that can be clicked to expand or collapse the associated content section below. Accordions are widely used to manage long lists of information, FAQs, or help topics without overwhelming the user with too much visible content at once."
  },
  {
    heading: "Why use an Accordion?",
    body: "Accordions help organize information in a compact way by hiding unnecessary details until the user wants to see them. This keeps pages cleaner, reduces visual clutter, and makes it easier for users to navigate through large amounts of information. They are especially useful for FAQs, documentation pages, and dashboards where space optimization is crucial."
  },
  {
    heading: "How do you style an Accordion?",
    body: "An accordion can be styled using plain CSS, utility frameworks like Tailwind CSS, or component libraries such as Material UI or Chakra UI. Styling typically includes customizing the headers, adding hover and active states, and animating the expansion or collapse of sections for a smooth user experience. You might also include icons, like arrows, that rotate when a section is opened or closed."
  },
  {
    heading: "Is React good for interactive UI components?",
    body: "Yes, React is excellent for building interactive UI components like accordions, tabs, modals, and carousels. With Reactâ€™s state management and component-based structure, you can easily control which section of an accordion is open, manage animations, and pass props to customize behavior. This makes React a great choice for creating modular and maintainable interactive elements."
